## Additional Pages Content

### About Page

#### Hero Section
**Headline:** Built by Marketers Who Get It  
**Subheadline:** We've been in your shoes. Now we're here to help you run faster.

#### Our Story Section
**Heading:** Why Luumi Exists

**Content:**
Luumi Media was born from frustration with the status quo. 

Too many agencies promised the moon and delivered mediocre results. Too many creative teams forgot about the bottom line. Too many performance marketers forgot about the human element.

We decided to be different.

Based in India with a global mindset, we combine the entrepreneurial spirit of the startup ecosystem with the strategic thinking of seasoned marketers. Our team brings together diverse perspectives, cutting-edge tools, and a shared obsession with results.

We don't just run campaigns ‚Äî we build growth engines. We don't just create content ‚Äî we craft conversations. We don't just drive traffic ‚Äî we deliver transformation.

**The Luumi difference:**
- We've built and scaled our own brands (so we know what actually works)
- We measure everything but optimize for what matters
- We move at startup speed with enterprise-level thinking
- We believe great marketing feels effortless to the customer

#### Our Values Section
**Heading:** What Drives Us

**Value 1: Clarity Wins**  
Confused customers don't convert. We obsess over making the complex simple and the simple compelling.

**Value 2: Systems Scale**  
Random acts of marketing create random results. We build repeatable systems that compound over time.

**Value 3: Data Decides**  
Opinions are interesting. Data is decisive. We test, measure, and optimize based on what actually works.

**Value 4: Speed Matters**  
Perfect is the enemy of done. We ship fast, learn faster, and iterate constantly.

**Value 5: Results Rule**  
Pretty presentations don't pay bills. We focus on metrics that matter: leads, sales, and growth.

#### Team Section
**Heading:** The Minds Behind the Magic

**Introduction:**
Our team is a carefully curated mix of strategists, creatives, and analysts who share one thing in common: an obsession with growth. From former startup founders to ex-agency veterans, each team member brings unique expertise to the table.
